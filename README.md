# World Percussion Digital Music Instrument

This project was completed in the scope of the MUMT619 course.
This was a collaboration between Antoine A. and Jiawen M.

The arduino file processes IMU data for gesture recognition and sends values over UART as a result to a MaxMSP patch, which plays back sounds from the sound library.
A Leap controller also adjusts parameters in the patch.

A demonstration of the instrument can be found at https://www.antoineaubet.com/instrument
